i keep trying to find a life on my own apart from you 
i am the king of excuces , and i have got one for evrything i do 
what is going on inside of me 
i despise my own behovavior
i wanna be in the light as you are in the light
i wanna shine like the stars in the heaven 
every attempt on my behalf has failed to bring the sickness under control
but this severs to confirm my suspisions
i am still a man in need of a saviour 
i wanna be in the light as you are inthe light
oh Lord be my light and be my salvation
